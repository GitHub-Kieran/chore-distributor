# Chore Distributor

Distribute your chores to multiple people based on weightings.

Who takes the bins out? Who washes the pots? How much effort does that take?

Use this tool to assign chores to individuals based on how much effort you think they're worth.


### Linear Chore Distribution

Loop through all the chores in order and assign them to people in order of occurance. 
This method of chore distribution can result in unequal distribution if the chores are not already ordered in the preffered way.

### Random Chore Distribution

Randomly choose chores for people. There is no consideration of chore weight.

### Equal Chore Distribution

Find the fairest combination of chores for each person, based on the weight of each chore.
For example, given 5 chores with a combined weight of 38, and 2 people, each person would recieve
a combination of chores with a summed weight closest to 19.
